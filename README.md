The Project Description is
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the Indian hospitality sector, boasts an array of five-star hotels strewn across the country. With a two-decade-long presence in the industry, they have garnered a reputation for excellence. However, recent challenges have emerged in the form of competitive strategies by rivals and managerial decisions that failed to hit the mark. This unfortunate combination has led to a decline in both their market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotels segment. Recognizing the urgency, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands has embarked on a strategic initiative. Their goal is to reinvigorate their standing by embracing the power of "Business and Data Intelligence." This strategic pivot is aimed at reclaiming their lost market share and revitalizing revenue streams.
